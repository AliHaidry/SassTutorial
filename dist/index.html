            The concept of DevOps is gradually becoming more popular in the software development industry. 
            With more teams looking to implement an agile methodology of product development, DevOps is helping make it possible. 
            Teams can now push code regularly, automate the deployment pipeline, and have Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery as part of the release process.
